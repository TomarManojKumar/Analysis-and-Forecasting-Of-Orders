# Analysis-and-Forecasting-Of-Orders
Analysis and Forecasting of orders on basis of orders occurred every week for a meal delivery company so that they can be prepared for upcoming orders and the operational area with respect to the different food categories for each location in different region and city.
Dashboards are interlinked to each other so we can analyse and check forecast orders, avg (base & checkout) price, orders with respect to each cuisine & meal for each region/city/center.
